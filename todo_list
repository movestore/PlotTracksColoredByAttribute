# To do list (doing one out of all):
## good to have:
1. (done) color the tracks by the values of a selected attribute by the user
2. (done) keep the possibility to visualize all tracks on one map, or each track on a single map.
3. (done) make it easier to select/unselect all individuals at once
4. (?) distinguish between categorical and continuous attributes when choosing the color scale (probably just in the code, saying if there are less than XX values in the attribute it can be considered categorical, and if there are more, than it is continuous, or something like that)
5. (done) offer the user the possibility to choose among several color palette options
6. (done) check options for background maps (OSM, stadia, leaflet, mapview, etc. I back then I tried leaflet, but than the problem was that it was tricky to give each  segment its color. Maybe that is now easier). Here a book just on interactive and non interactive maps: Making Maps with R (https://bookdown.org/nicohahn/making_maps_with_r5/docs/introduction.html)
7. (done) make the maps interactive (user can zoom in and out ideally with the mouse)
8. () provide the possibility to download the visualization as a png, html, etc, for the user to included in reports, manuscripts, presentations, etc and any other feature that seems useful that comes up on the way
9. (not relevant with leaflet) make multipanel with aspect ratio==1, look into cowplot pkg - this is a very old comment, not sure if cowplot is the solution. Probably this will not anymore be a problem
10. () Add the results to the move2 object. For example, add something like an attribute 'color' containing the hexadecimal code for the color and an attribute 'color-legend' containing the value used to define the color. This would allow the results to be saved as an RDS or passed on to a subsequent app to create a shapefile, kml, etc.
11. (?) implement a color-reuse strategy for 100+ individuals (reuse non-adjacent colors to avoid confusion)

## nice to have
1. () make it possible to color by 2 attributes, eg color by speed and sex. One idea would be e.g. to use shades of green to represents the speeds of males, shares of red for females and shades of blue for unknown/undefined. Or if it is speed and trackID, than each trackID gets the shades of another color.
2. (done) offer options to chose point symbol, line type, size, alpha. Not all options might be needed, giving to many options might be overwhelming, but some that make sense is good. Not sure how to go about this, I guess it just has to be tested and in relation to other options if it is overwhelming or not.
